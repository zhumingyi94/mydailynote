### Constructing solution for linear equation 
- Understand that $A \vec{x} = \vec{b}$ is the transformation from $\vec{x}$ to $\vec{b}$. 
- We also see that for set of vector $\vec{x'}$ that satisfies this $A \vec{x'} = 0$ or $null(A) = ker(A) = \{\mathbf{x'}\in K^n | A\mathbf{x'}=0\}$ is the set of vector that always become 0 when apply transformation using $A$
=> This implies that if we want to construct a solution for system of linear equation first we need to find a particular solution that transform from $\vec{x}$ to $\vec{b}$ and add a set of $\vec{x'}$

### Minus-1 Trick

### Calculate the Inverse

### Algorithm for solving system of equation
If $\mathbf{A}$ is not a square matrix, we can use this transformation 
$$
\mathbf{Ax} = \mathbf{b} 

$$
