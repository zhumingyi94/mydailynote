![[Pasted image 20240803025324.png]]
##### <font color="#0070c0">Training process</font>
- Features extraction using CNN
![[Pasted image 20240803025425.png]]
- Make the network predict as near as 1 for similar training sample

>[!info]- **f** is the same CNN with exactly same hyperparameters 

>[!info] The training data for the Siamese network does not contains the n classes. 

Refer to [[Triplet Loss]] as the other way of training Siamese network
### Exercise
>[!question]- What is the overall architecture of Siamese network ?
?

>[!question]- How to formulate the training data for Siamese network
