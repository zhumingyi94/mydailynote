# neural network

- Video: [Building a neural network FROM SCRATCH (no Tensorflow/Pytorch, just numpy & math) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU)
- Key taking:
	- When we deal with image, it's better to scale down /255, this can help exploding gradient problem
	- How to determine the shape of $W$ between layers
