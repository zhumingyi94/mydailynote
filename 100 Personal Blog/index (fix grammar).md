## Why I create this blog
I am Du Mingyi, <font color="#ff0000">**nickname**</font><u>d</u>  "không một." (English: Zero and One)
I <font color="#ff0000">create</font><u>d</u> this blog for two main goals:
1. **<font color="#ff0000">To</font>** practice my English because it~~'s~~ kinda sucks. I want to improve this so much because I want to talk with interesting people more. I want to connect with people and open ~~the~~ ~~uncountable~~ <font color="#ff0000">countless</font> opportunities to work with amazing people around the world. You can see how suck my English is just by reading this introduction (I don't even know other words or synonym<font color="#ff0000">s</font> that can replace the phrase "want to") 
2. I always think that if you don't share your knowledge or try to teach it to other people, your knowledge will ~~be deprecated~~ become outdated through time and then you<font color="#ff0000">'ll</font> forget it. Not only that, as Richard Feynman once said
> *"If you want to master something, **<font color="#00b050">teach</font>** it"*
\- Richard Feynman

So I will try as hard as I can base<font color="#ff0000">d</font> on my understanding of some concepts (mostly Machine Learning, Computer Science). I ~~am really~~ would be <font color="#ff0000">really</font> grateful ~~if anyone feedback about~~ f<font color="#ff0000">or any feedback on</font> my posts.

## My interest
In some ~~senses~~ <font color="#ff0000">ways</font>, I think I really like **STEM** (not to the point ~~love it or adore it, just like it~~ of loving it or adoring it, just liking it), and I try to embrace this interest to ~~become~~ <font color="#ff0000">turn it into</font> love (Though, so far, I~~'m~~ <font color="#ff0000">have been</font> distracted by other thing<font color="#ff0000">s</font> like: anime, girls, video games, fast food~~s~~ ... this blog is kinda a way for me to counter these negative habits). ~~In the time tha~~ <font color="#ff0000">As</font> I write this, I ~~prepare~~ <font color="#ff0000">am preparing</font> ~~going~~ to <font color="#ff0000">enter</font> <font color="#ff0000">my</font> sophomore year; my major is Artificial Intelligence :D 

#### Design
I love designing ~~or create~~ <font color="#ff0000">and creating</font> anything that is beautiful or visually~~-attracted~~ <font color="#ff0000">appealing</font> (I am still an amateur in this field and just design for fun). I am extremely limited in knowledge ~~about~~ of **UX and UI**. In fact, I ~~just~~ only know some basics rules like: **<u>KEEP IT SIMPLE</u>** or <u>**YOUR LINE-HEIGHT SHOULD OCCUPIED SMALLER SPACE FOR LARGER TEXT SIZE** </u>, etc ...

Here are some of my <font color="#ff0000">designs</font> (Web, notion template, github README and Slides; because of ~~the~~ privacy I will not list all of my designs):

#### Coding
I have <font color="#ff0000">some</font> knowledge in both Software Engineer<font color="#ff0000">ing</font> and AI but **not ~~so~~<font color="#ff0000"> too</font> much**. Stay tune<font color="#ff0000">d</font>, I will try hard to update cool project ~~in~~ here (Sorry, I'm too lazy to record some of my demo<font color="#ff0000">s</font> and publish ~~it~~ <font color="#ff0000">them</font> ~~in~~ here) 
#### Music
I like playing guitar and listening to Mathrock, J-Pop. I am an amateur fingerstyle guitarist (I ~~dropped~~ stopped ~~it~~ playing about 2 years <font color="#ff0000">ago</font> but I still think I can ~~still~~ play it). I know a little bit about music theory, just enough to understand how chords ~~are accompanied together~~ <font color="#ff0000">fit together</font>. 
## My story
Just a little (short) 20-year-old guy ~~lives~~ <font color="#ff0000">living</font> in Asia<font color="#ff0000">,</font> try<font color="#ff0000">ing</font> to become better and ~~seeks~~ <font color="#ff0000">seeking</font> oppoturnities to go ~~to the~~ oversea<font color="#ff0000">s</font> ~~in order~~ to meet more amazing people and help them create great thing<font color="#ff0000">s</font> for humanity.
